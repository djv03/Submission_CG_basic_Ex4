To see results: Simply open index.html in Firefox( compatability with other browsers is not ensured)

Note: If you encounter an error saying "Cross-Origin Request Blocked" in Firefox on the console and nothing is loaded, you can proceed in one of the following ways:

-Setup a server to load the page from (e.g. liveServer-extension for visual studio code).
-Disable the policy: In Firefox, type "about:config" into the adress window and hit enter. Click "I accept the risk!" to continue to the Firefox configurations. Search for "origin" and double-click on "security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy" to make its value change from true to false. This should do the trick!
